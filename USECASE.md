(optional file for Automation Exchange entries) _Describe the use case for Automation Exchange entries here. [DevNet Automation Exchange](https://developer.cisco.com/network-automation/) provides shared code repositories for gathering information from your network, performing audits, activating policy changes, or managing applications, users, or devices. This file serves as a template to collect related links for Automation Exchange submissions._

This introductory paragraph can set the context for your use case, describing the situation you found yourself in, the business or industry this solution could work well within, or provide background on the technologies in the use case.

Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) formatting in this file. 

## Problem Statement: Business Problem Solved with Use Case 

Provide the existing condition and a brief description of why the problem happens, especially if some context is useful to help describe why it's a problem.

Use images if they can visually describe the problem. 

A video would be great to use here to state the context or situation you found yourself in that caused the problem you needed to solve. 

## Solution: How to Solve the Problem

Describe the end-state you want to acheive. What were the impacts you saw as a result of solving the problem statement? What is the suggested course of action to take to put this solution into place? Use as much detail as you would in your How-to guidance in the README file, and point to or rephrase the README sections here as needed.

Ideally you can provide an image or diagram explaining the solution, perhaps the architecture or relationship between the technologies that help solve the problem. 

You can include a video pointer here as well if it helps describes the solution.

## Outcomes: What Happened as a Result 

Provide some possible business outcomes or answer, "What happens next?" as a result of solving the problem. Who benefited? What were some of the metrics that you measured and what changed as as result of putting this solution into place? How many weeks, months, or years does it take for the metrics to be meaningful? Include any specific information for your business or industry.
