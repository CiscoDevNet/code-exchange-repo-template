In addition to identifying an appropriate sandbox, be sure to provide instructions and any configuration necessary to run your code with the sandbox.

## How to test the software

Provide details on steps to test, versions of components/dependencies against which code was tested, date the code was last tested, etc. 
If the repo includes automated tests, detail how to run those tests.
If the repo is instrumented with a continuous testing framework, that is even better.
