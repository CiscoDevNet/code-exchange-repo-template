## Use Case Description

Summarize the problem statement and solution with outcomes, benefits, and metrics in this section. You can also talk about challenges you had to overcome as part of the solution, and optional ideas you have in mind that could further extend your solution.

For more in-depth descriptions of your business context around the use case, fill in the USECASE.md file. Describe the business problem this code addresses in the Problem Statement section. Provide context and the solution in the Solution section. In the Outcomes section, discuss the benefits, what metrics changed as a result, how long it takes to make progress or gather data. Include images or diagrams that help explain the architecture or technology as it fits into the business or industry. 

## Installation

Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running. Call out any dependencies. This should be frequently tested and updated to make sure it works reliably, accounts for updated versions of dependencies, etc.

## Configuration

If the code is configurable, describe it in detail, either here or in other documentation that you reference.

## Usage

Show users how to use the code. Be specific.
Use appropriate formatting when showing code snippets or command line output.

### DevNet Sandbox

A great way to make your repo easy for others to use is to provide a link to a [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/) that provides a network or other resources required to use this code. In addition to identifying an appropriate sandbox, be sure to provide instructions and any configuration necessary to run your code with the sandbox.

## How to test the software

Provide details on steps to test, versions of components/dependencies against which code was tested, date the code was last tested, etc. 
If the repo includes automated tests, detail how to run those tests.
If the repo is instrumented with a continuous testing framework, that is even better.
